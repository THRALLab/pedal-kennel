Define a function `make_pig_latin` that consumes a word (a string) and converts it to actual pig latin (also a string). If the first letter of the word is a vowel, just return that word with `"ay"` added to the end. Otherwise, take the first character of the word and move it to the end of the string, and *then* add `"ay"` to the end. Do not worry about capitalization. If the empty string is given, return `"ay"`.

description = Let us return to the salary data we saw a few problems ago. Previously, we looked at the distribution of the `mean_salary` data. Now we will compare that data with the `median_salary` data and then the `members` data to see if there are any correlations. Create *two* visualizations:
	
	1. The first should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `median_salary` (y-axis)
	2. The second should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `members` (y-axis)
	
	Make sure you give meaningful labels to the axes and a title.

description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

gpt_feedback = Your code has a few issues. First, in your function definition for `available_jobs`, the return type should be `list[Job]` instead of `list[job]`. Python is case-sensitive, so `Job` and `job` are not the same. Second, in your `best_job` function, you're comparing `job.salary` to `maximum`, but `maximum` is not defined in this scope. You should compare `job.salary` to `y`, which is the result of your `highest_salary` function. Lastly, in your test cases, you have a syntax error. You should use `==` instead of `=` for comparison in your `assert_equal` function. Also, you need to define your lists with `=` instead of `:`.

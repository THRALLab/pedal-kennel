description = Define the function `high_score` that consumes a list of integers (representing scores in a game) and produces an integer representing the highest score in the list. Ignore scores less than `100`, and stop processing values if you encounter `-999`. If the list is empty, return the value `None` instead. It is up to you to decompose this function (or not) however you want.

gpt_feedback = Your code has a logical error in the high_score function. This function should ideally return the highest score from the scores list. Currently, however, your function might not always get as far as checking all the scores because it stops running as soon as it encounters -999. If you want the function to return the highest score, irrespective of whether -999 is present or not, you should ensure that the loop iterates over all the scores before breaking.

Secondly, there's nothing in 'is_morning' that is calling these functions or returning a result, so 'is_morning' will always return None.

Don't forget there is one exception to this rule, for words that start with a vowel, the 'ay' is simply tagged to the end. Consider modifying your if condition to cater for words starting with a vowel or consonant, and mitigate the resulting actions accordingly.

[bakery_nesting_list_dataclasses_code_good_job]
description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

	1. In your function `available`, you are iterating over `avail` with variable `avai` but then you are checking `avail.available` for True which should be `avai.available`.
	
	2. Your function is returning `False` at the end. As you are appending values to `taking`, you should return `taking` instead of `False`.
	
	3. You have imported `assert_equal` from module `bakery`, are you sure about this module? Normally, `assert_equal` is part of 'unittest' module in Python.

	- The 'waiter' variable is undefined, perhaps you meant to use 'server'.
	
	- When calling the 'assert_equal' function, the second parameter should be the expected job, instead of a salary or 'UNEMPLOYED'. You should compare the outcome with an instance of a Job, since your function returns a Job instance.
	
	- For test case 'best_job([server])', the server job is not available, so it should indeed return the UNEMPLOYED job. However, you stated it incorrectly in the assert_equal() function. You should expect 'UNEMPLOYED' not 'waiter'.
	
	- For the test case 'best_job([painter])', the assert_equal() function should expect the 'painter' job, not its salary.

gpt_feedback = Good start! However, there are several typographical errors in your code. Keep an eye on the spelling of variable and method names - Python is case-sensitive. For example, you've attempted to use the misspelled keyword 'avalible' instead of 'available'. Also, in your best_job function, you have a typo in the part where it says 'job.salary > best_job.slary', which should be 'job.salary > best_job.salary'. Furthermore, the assert_equal function is not defined.

gpt_feedback = There are a couple of issues in your code. First, the type hint for your function's return type is incorrect, it should be 'Job' instead of 'job'. Secondly, you've made a syntax error when defining your lists of 'Job' objects: you've used colons ':' instead of equals signs '=', when you're intending to assign values to variables. Also the module 'bakery' for your 'assert_equal' method seems to be unavailable or non-existent in standard Python libraries; you might want to use 'assert' instead. Lastly, the variable 'maximum' is undefined in your 'best_job' function, you've defined it in the 'highest_salary' function but it's not available outside of this function. Instead, you should use the variable 'y' which is the result of the function 'highest_salary'.

description = Let us return to the salary data we saw a few problems ago. Previously, we looked at the distribution of the `mean_salary` data. Now we will compare that data with the `median_salary` data and then the `members` data to see if there are any correlations. Create *two* visualizations:

	1. The first should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `median_salary` (y-axis)
	2. The second should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `members` (y-axis)

	Make sure you give meaningful labels to the axes and a title.

	You are provided the following code in the `bakery_salary.py` file. Assume `raw_salaries.csv` is a valid CSV file:

	```python
	from dataclasses import dataclass

	@dataclass

gpt_feedback = Your code seems mostly correct, however, there's a possible semantic confusion. The 'plt.hist()' function in matplotlib library is used for creating histograms, which are a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into specified ranges. In your context, it would be more appropriate to use a bar plot if you want to compare the mean salaries of the different industries. Because in a histogram the x-axis is for ranges of values (in this case salary ranges) not for categories (e.g., industries). Then, your x and y labels should match the new chart. Try using 'plt.bar()' function instead. Remember you need values for both x-axis (industries) and y-axis (mean salaries) for a bar plot.

gpt_feedback = There seems to be a mistake with your import statement. In Python, when you import a module, you don't need to add the .py extension. Also, it seems like you're trying to print a variable 'art'. Make sure this variable is defined in the module you're importing. Your import statement should look like this: 'import my_second_module'. Then, if 'art' is a variable in that module, you can access it like so: 'print(my_second_module.art)'.

gpt_feedback = The Python syntax to import something from a different file is not correct in your code. The proper way to import a module in Python is 'from module_name import something'. There seems to be an unnecessary '.py'. Try removing it so your code reads 'from my_second_module import art'. Also, make sure that 'my_second_module' is in the same directory as your current script or is installed in your Python environment.

gpt_feedback = Python importing does not require the .py extension. You should just write 'import my_second_module'. Additionally, you should ensure that 'my_second_module' exists in the same directory as your main program or in your Python path. Also, make sure the variable 'art' exists in the 'my_second_module'.

gpt_feedback = It seems like you're trying to import a module in Python, but the syntax you're using isn't correct. The 'from' keyword in Python is used to import specific parts (functions, variables, etc.) from a module. Importing a script or a file with the '.py' extension is not a built-in functionality in Python. If you want to import a Python file, you can just use 'import filename_without_extension'. For your case, if 'my_second_module' is located in the same directory and it contains the variable 'art', you can use the command 'from my_second_module import art'.

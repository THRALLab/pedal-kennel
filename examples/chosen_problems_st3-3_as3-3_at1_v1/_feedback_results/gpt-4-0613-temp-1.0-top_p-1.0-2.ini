description = Define the function `high_score` that consumes a list of integers (representing scores in a game) and produces an integer representing the highest score in the list. Ignore scores less than `100`, and stop processing values if you encounter `-999`. If the list is empty, return the value `None` instead. It is up to you to decompose this function (or not) however you want.

gpt_feedback = You are on the right track with your function. However, there are a few errors that you should consider amending. You have correctly given -999 the functionality to end the iteration process. However, it will not successfully find the highest score, should it exist after -999 in the list. Given that the presence of -999 should 'end the game', you might not want to check the scores after it, but if you do, this is something to consider. Also, your annotation of the input type in the function definition is not correct. It should be `List[int]` not `[int]`.

gpt_feedback = You're on the right track with this code, but there are a few potential issues to address. Firstly, be wary of return statements in loops because they will stop the loop the moment they are called, so if you have a return statement in an if condition inside a loop, the loop will stop the moment that condition is met. This happens in your code at 'if score > max_num:', where the function will return max_num and stop, even if there are more scores in the list to check. Secondly, the variable 'mini' isn't used in the function, consider removing it for cleaner code. Finally, you don't actually need to check if score==-999 because you break your loop if score == -999. You should also consider how Python interprets empty lists. Comparing your list to another empty list such as 'if scores == empty_list' is unnecessary and you can simply use 'if not scores' to check if your list is empty.

The check for the list length should be done before attempting to access elements in the list. Also, you don't need to check for -999 because the problem statement does not require it.

Lastly, your 'else' clause is commented out and incomplete, you would need this clause to handle when the word does not start with a vowel.

In your specific case, you probably meant to pass the actual words as strings, and not the variable names. Lastly, 'word[1:]+word[0]+'ay'' is not correct for transforming a word into pig latin.

The line `elif Word[0] not in "aeiouAEIOU" and ""` seems to include an additional and operator with an empty string. This is not adding any logical check and might be causing confusion.

description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

gpt_feedback = There are a few things that need correcting in your code:
	
	1. The 'waiter' job you've defined is named 'server', but you're referring to it as 'waiter' when passing it in the assert_equal function. The names should match.
	
	2. In your first assert_equal function, instead of comparing the output with the number 8500, you should compare it with the Job instance that has the highest salary and is available. The result should be the Job object itself, not the salary.
	
	3. In your last assert_equal function, youre comparing the best_job function result with the salary of the painter job, you should compare the result with the instance of the job itself as your 'best_job' function returns a Job instance.
	
	Try fixing these issues and run the code again!

gpt_feedback = You seem to be returning the salary of the best job instead of the job itself. In the line `greatest_job = job.salary`, job.salary is just the numeric salary part of the job, not the job object. Therefore, your function currently returns a number instead of a Job object. Also, assign the full job object to `greatest_job` whenever a job with a higher salary is found, and return `greatest_job` at the end of your function. Then, when you do comparisons, check against `greatest_job.salary` instead of `greatest_job`.

gpt_feedback = In your code, you're iterating over the jobs and correctly checking if the job is unavailable before considering its salary. However, there are a couple issues with your code.
	
	1. You're returning the title of the job instead of the job object itself. The function signature indicates that a Job object should be returned, not a string.
	
	2. Additionally, your if condition currently excludes all available jobs. It looks like you want to find the highest-paying available job, so you should actually be checking if job.available is True.
	
	Try to fix these errors and run the code again.

Your corrected line should be: assert_equal(best_job(list3), Job("Unemployed", 0, True, "None")). Also, ensure that you initialize your lists properly. The syntax you used (list1:[Job...]) is incorrect. You should use the equal sign (=) instead of colon (:).

student_code =

gpt_feedback = Your code already works well! It correctly declares a list of books and then prints the list. If you are looking to improve it or add more complexity, think about what else you might want to do with books. Maybe you could write a function to search for a particular book in your list, add a book to your list, or remove a book. You might also want to implement some error checking to make sure that the user is interacting with the list in a valid way.

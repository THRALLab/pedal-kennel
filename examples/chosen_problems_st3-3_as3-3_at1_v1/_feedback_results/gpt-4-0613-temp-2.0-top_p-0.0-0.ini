description = Define the function `high_score` that consumes a list of integers (representing scores in a game) and produces an integer representing the highest score in the list. Ignore scores less than `100`, and stop processing values if you encounter `-999`. If the list is empty, return the value `None` instead. It is up to you to decompose this function (or not) however you want.

	assert_equal(high_score([70]), None)
gpt_feedback = Your function seems to be working fine for most cases, but it might fail for some edge cases. For example, if the highest score is after -999 in the list, your function will not consider it because you are breaking the loop when you encounter -999. If -999 is not a valid score and you want to ignore it, you should continue the loop instead of breaking it. Also, you don't need to check if there are scores greater than or equal to 100 at the beginning of your function. You can simply initialize 'to_return' to None and return it if it remains None after the loop.

description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

gpt_feedback = There are a few issues with your code. First, in the function signature of 'available_jobs', you have 'list[job]' as the return type. Python is case-sensitive, so it should be 'list[Job]'. Second, in the 'best_job' function, you are comparing 'job.salary' with 'maximum', but 'maximum' is not defined in this scope. You should compare it with 'y' which is the highest salary among available jobs. Lastly, in your assert_equal statements, you have 'UNEMPLOYED = Job(...)', which is not valid syntax. You should just have 'UNEMPLOYED'.

description = Let us return to the salary data we saw a few problems ago. Previously, we looked at the distribution of the `mean_salary` data. Now we will compare that data with the `median_salary` data and then the `members` data to see if there are any correlations. Create *two* visualizations:

	1. The first should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `median_salary` (y-axis)
	2. The second should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `members` (y-axis)

	Make sure you give meaningful labels to the axes and a title.

	You are provided the following code in the `bakery_salary.py` file. Assume `raw_salaries.csv` is a valid CSV file:

	```python
	from dataclasses import dataclass

	@dataclass
	class Industry:
	    """
	    Information about an individual industry.

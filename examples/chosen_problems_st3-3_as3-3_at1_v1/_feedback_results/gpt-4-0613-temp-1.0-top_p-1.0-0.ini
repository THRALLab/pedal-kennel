description = Define the function `high_score` that consumes a list of integers (representing scores in a game) and produces an integer representing the highest score in the list. Ignore scores less than `100`, and stop processing values if you encounter `-999`. If the list is empty, return the value `None` instead. It is up to you to decompose this function (or not) however you want.

gpt_feedback = Your code seems to be set up correctly to handle empty and low-score lists, but there's a problem with the way you're using the break statement. The break is used to exit the closest enclosing loop, which in this case would be the for loop. However, if your score equals -999, you don't necessarily want to exit the entire function, but just ignore that specific score. Instead of using break, you could continue with the loop and check if the score is not equal to -999 before checking if it's greater than or equal to 'to_return'.

gpt_feedback = Your function seems logically fine up to the point where you calculate the maximum number. However, there are a few issues that need to be corrected:
	
	1. You do not need to check for `score==-999:` twice in your function. You can remove one of them.
	2. Your function should continue to check for scores even if it finds a score that is less than `mini`. So, there is no need to `continue` when `score < mini`. 
	3. You return the `max_num` immediately when you find a score greater than the current `max_num` but, you should let the loop run for all elements then return the `max_num` after the loop is over.
	4. Your check for an empty list can be simplified to `if not scores:`. This check if the list is empty.
	
	Correct these issues and try running your program again.

gpt_feedback = Your code seems well-structured, but you need to think about the initial value of `highest_score`. You're initiating it with the first score, but what if the first score is less than 100? In the function's current state, it might incorrectly return this score as the highest, even if it doesn't meet the criterion of being at least 100. To address this, consider starting `highest_score` at zero, and include an additional check to ensure that any score considered 'highest' must also be greater than or equal to 100.

You stop your count when your number is -999 but then also check if that -999 is greater than or equal to 100 which will never be true. Also, it seems your assertion is failing because you initiate your max variable with the first value of the list, so if the first value is the highest, even if the count stops, it's this value that gets returned.

gpt_feedback = Great job on checking if the first letter of the word is a vowel and returning the word with 'ay' added at the end. Remember, in pig latin, if a word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster, it should be moved to the end of word before the 'ay' is added. In your current implementation, you're ignoring the possibility of a consonant cluster at the start of the word and moving only the first letter to the end. You need to handle the scenario when a word starts with multiple consonants.

gpt_feedback = Overall, your Pig Latin function seems to be working as it should except for one case. When the input is an empty string, your function returns 'ay' but standard convention in Pig Latin syntax for empty strings is to return an empty string itself, not 'ay'. It's important to spend more time understanding the problem definition to ensure that your implementation is correct. Please revise your error condition handling.

description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

The use of `max` function providing a `key` parameter performing the salary comparison is also properly done. Good job!

For instance, in your first `assert_equal`, you should compare the result of `best_job([painter, seamstress, waiter])` with 'painter' instead of 8500, because your function returns a `Job` object, not an integer. Secondly, the 'waiter' variable is not defined, please make sure you've named your variables correctly.

gpt_feedback = Your code has a few problems. First, in the function signature for 'available_jobs', the return type should be 'list[Job]' not 'list[job]'. Python is case sensitive and 'job' is not the same as 'Job'. Secondly, When initializing a list, you should declare list1 as list1 = [Job(...), Job(...)], not list1:[Job(...), Job(...)]. Be careful with the syntax. Lastly, there's a typo in the assert_equal statement for list3. It should be assert_equal(best_job(list3), UNEMPLOYED) without the '=' operator.

description = Let us return to the salary data we saw a few problems ago. Previously, we looked at the distribution of the `mean_salary` data. Now we will compare that data with the `median_salary` data and then the `members` data to see if there are any correlations. Create *two* visualizations:

	1. The first should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `median_salary` (y-axis)
	2. The second should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `members` (y-axis)

	Make sure you give meaningful labels to the axes and a title.

	You are provided the following code in the `bakery_salary.py` file. Assume `raw_salaries.csv` is a valid CSV file:

	```python
	from dataclasses import dataclass

	@dataclass
	class Industry:

gpt_feedback = It appears you're trying to import a Python module. In Python, when importing modules, you should not include the '.py' extension. Also, are you sure 'art' is defined in 'my_second_module'? If not, trying to print it will result in an error. Next, if 'my_second_module' is not a standard Python library, ensure it's located in the same directory as your current Python script or a directory that's in your PYTHONPATH.

gpt_feedback = In Python, when you are importing modules, the .py extension is not necessary. So, your import statement should be `from my_second_module import art` instead of `from my_second_module.py import art`. Also, make sure that the `my_second_module` Python file is in the same directory as your current Python script.

gpt_feedback = It looks like you are trying to import a Python module using an incorrect syntax. In Python, you don't need to include the '.py' extension when importing a module. Also, is 'art' a variable or a function from 'my_second_module'? If it's a function, you'll need to call it with parentheses like 'art()'. If it's a variable, then your code should work as expected after you correct the import statement.

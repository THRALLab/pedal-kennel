description = Define the function `high_score` that consumes a list of integers (representing scores in a game) and produces an integer representing the highest score in the list. Ignore scores less than `100`, and stop processing values if you encounter `-999`. If the list is empty, return the value `None` instead. It is up to you to decompose this function (or not) however you want.

	assert_equal(high_score([70]), None)
gpt_feedback = Your function seems to be working fine for most cases, but it might fail for some edge cases. For example, if the highest score is after -999 in the list, your function will not consider it because you are breaking the loop when you encounter -999. If -999 is not a valid score and you want to ignore it, you should use 'continue' instead of 'break'. This will skip the current iteration and continue with the next one. Also, you don't need to check if there are scores greater than or equal to 100 at the beginning of your function. You can simply start with 'to_return' as None and update it whenever you find a higher score.

gpt_feedback = Your code seems to be almost correct, but there's a small mistake in your condition check. In the line `elif Word[0] not in "aeiouAEIOU" and "":`, the `and ""` part doesn't make sense. Python is interpreting this as `and bool("")`, which is always False because an empty string is considered False in a boolean context. You might want to remove this part of the condition.

description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

Second, in your assertions, you're comparing a Job object with an integer which will always fail. You should compare the 'salary' attribute of the returned Job object with the expected salary. Lastly, you've defined a Job object named 'server' but you're trying to use 'waiter' which is not defined. You should correct this.

You should compare it with 'y', which is the highest salary among available jobs. Lastly, in your test cases, you are trying to assign a value to 'UNEMPLOYED' which is a constant. You should compare 'best_job(list3)' with 'UNEMPLOYED' instead of trying to assign a new value to it.

description = Let us return to the salary data we saw a few problems ago. Previously, we looked at the distribution of the `mean_salary` data. Now we will compare that data with the `median_salary` data and then the `members` data to see if there are any correlations. Create *two* visualizations:

	1. The first should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `median_salary` (y-axis)
	2. The second should show the relationship between `mean_salary` (x-axis) and `members` (y-axis)

	Make sure you give meaningful labels to the axes and a title.

	You are provided the following code in the `bakery_salary.py` file. Assume `raw_salaries.csv` is a valid CSV file:

	```python
	from dataclasses import dataclass

	@dataclass
	class Industry:

gpt_feedback = It seems like you're trying to import a module and print a variable from it. However, there are a couple of issues with your code. First, when importing a module in Python, you don't need to include the '.py' extension. Second, make sure that the variable 'art' is defined in the module you're importing. Your code should look something like this:

	import my_second_module
	print(my_second_module.art)
gpt_feedback_length = 63
gpt_score = 0.0
pedal_feedback = You should not have the `.py` part of the filename in your `import` statement. Only use the name of the module on its own!

gpt_feedback = It seems like you're trying to calculate the average of a list of integers. However, in your 'average' function, you're not actually calling the 'summate' and 'count' functions. Remember to call a function, you need to use parentheses '()'. Also, you're not passing any arguments to these functions. You should pass 'avg' as an argument to both functions. Finally, the average is calculated by dividing the sum by the count, not by adding them. You should divide the result of 'summate' by 'count'.

gpt_feedback = Your function `cut_day` is correctly slicing the last three characters from the input string. However, the way you've set up the default values in the function definition is not correct. In Python, the `or` operator returns the first 'truthy' value it encounters, or the last value if none are truthy. So, `"Wednesday" or "Thursday" or "Saturday"` will always evaluate to "Wednesday". If you want to check if the input is one of these three values, you should do that inside the function. For example, you could use an `if` statement to check if `day_of_week` is in a list of valid days.

[bakery_if_patterns_dispatch_math]
description = Define a function `dispatch_math` that consumes a string and two integers, and produces an integer. The first argument (the string) represents an operator: either `"+"`, `"-"`, or `"*"`. The second and third arguments (the integers) are meant to represent the operands for the given operator. The result will be the addition, subtraction, or product of the two operands based on the first parameter. If any other operator is given, just return `0`.

	assert_equal(dispatch_math('*', 1, 0), 0)
	assert_equal(dispatch_math('/', 2, 2), 1)
gpt_feedback = There are a few issues with your code. Firstly, the condition '+-/*' not in operator is not checking if the operator is one of '+', '-', '*', '/'. It's checking if the string '+-/*' is not in the operator. You should use a list or a set to check if the operator is one of the valid operators. Secondly, the expression (a + operator + b) is not performing the operation, it's concatenating the strings. You should use if-elif statements to perform the correct operation based on the operator. Lastly, your test case assert_equal(dispatch_math('*', 1, 0), 0) is incorrect. The multiplication of 1 and 0 is 0, so the function should return 0, not an error.

gpt_feedback = Your code seems to be correct and it should work as expected if the inputs are numbers and the operator is one of '+', '-', '*' or '/'. However, it's always a good idea to include error handling in your code. For example, what if the operator is '/' and num2 is 0? Your current code would raise a ZeroDivisionError.

gpt_feedback = Your function `rainiest_cloudy` seems to be calculating the maximum rainfall, but it's not clear what it's supposed to return. The function is currently returning a boolean value indicating whether the weather was cloudy on the day with the maximum rainfall. However, the function name suggests that it should return the rainiest day that was also cloudy. You might want to reconsider what your function should return. Also, the `max_day` variable is not being used anywhere. Lastly, the `assert_equal` function is not defined in your code, and its usage is unclear. It seems like you are trying to test your function, but the arguments passed to `assert_equal` don't match the expected inputs and outputs of the `rainiest_cloudy` function.

It seems like you are trying to compare two objects of the `Turtle` class. In Python, you can use the `==` operator to compare two objects but you need to implement the `__eq__` method in your class. Here is an example:
	
	```
	@dataclass(eq=True)
	class Turtle:
	    speed: int
	    direction: int

	Now you can use `==` to compare two `Turtle` objects:
	
	```
	assert point_turtle(Turtle(2, 1), 3) == Turtle(2, 3)
	```
	
	Try to implement this in your code.

description = The following message was originally shouting too loudly, and the author wants to have it quieter (by making it lowercase). However, it doesn't seem to be working. Fix the code so that variable's value is correctly lowered.

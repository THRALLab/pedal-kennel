An `Address` is a dataclass with the fields `number` (integer), `street` (string), `city` (string), and `state` (string). Define the dataclass, create an instance representing the address `18 Amstel Ave, Newark, DE`, store the `Address` in the variable `location`, and print the instance's state field.

If you can't tell, the `street` portion is `Amstel Ave`. Do not include the commas in the `street`, `city`, or `state`.

Hint: Print the instance's **state field**. Do not print the entire instance!

gpt_feedback = Your function is almost correct, but there's an issue with your loop. You are returning 'fruitless' as soon as you encounter a food item that is not 'apple', 'orange', or 'banana'. This means that if the first item in the list is not one of these three, your function will return 'fruitless' even if there are valid fruits later in the list. You should only return 'fruitless' after you have checked all the items in the list and found no valid fruits.

gpt_feedback = The function 'until_period' is returning in the first iteration of the loop itself. This is because the 'return' statement is inside the 'for' loop. Also, the 'append' method in Python modifies the list it is called on and doesn't return anything, so 'newords=newords.append(word)' will assign None to 'newords'. You need to simply call 'newords.append(word)' without assigning it to 'newords'.

gpt_feedback = It seems like you're trying to remove a period from a list. The way you've written your function, it will only remove the first period it encounters. Also, you're reassigning 'new_list' to 'removeDot', which will make 'new_list' reference the same list as 'removeDot'. Any changes you make to 'new_list' will also affect 'removeDot'.

gpt_feedback = Your function `cut_day` does not behave as expected. The problem lies in the default value of your function parameter. The expression `'Wednesday' or 'Thursday' or 'Saturday'` does not mean that the default value of `day_of_week` can be any of these three strings. In Python, the `or` operator returns the first 'truthy' value it encounters, so in this case, the default value of `day_of_week` will always be 'Wednesday'. You should change your function to only have one default value, or remove the default value altogether if it's not necessary.

[bakery_if_patterns_dispatch_math]
description = Define a function `dispatch_math` that consumes a string and two integers, and produces an integer. The first argument (the string) represents an operator: either `"+"`, `"-"`, or `"*"`. The second and third arguments (the integers) are meant to represent the operands for the given operator. The result will be the addition, subtraction, or product of the two operands based on the first parameter. If any other operator is given, just return `0`.

[bakery_if_patterns_dispatch_math.Lanturn_1.py]

	assert_equal(dispatch_math('*', 1, 0), 0)
	assert_equal(dispatch_math('/', 2, 2), 1)
gpt_feedback = There are a few issues with your code. Firstly, the condition `'+-/*' not in operator` will not work as expected. This condition checks if the entire string '+-/*' is in the operator, not if the operator is one of '+', '-', '*' or '/'. You should use something like `operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']` instead.
	
	Secondly, `(a + operator + b)` is incorrect. This will attempt to concatenate the numbers `a` and `b` with the string `operator`, which is not what you want. You need to perform the math operation represented by the operator on `a` and `b`. You can use `if` or `elif` statements to check what the operator is and perform the correct operation.
	
	Lastly, your second test case `assert_equal(dispatch_math('*', 1, 0), 0)` is incorrect. The multiplication of 1 and 0 is 0, so if the function is corrected, this test case will fail. You should change the expected result to match the correct outcome of the operation.

	1. There seems to be a typo in the word 'recipies' in the assert_equal function. It should be 'recipes'.
	
	2. The 'merge_recipes' function is supposed to return a Recipe object but currently, it's returning a tuple. You should create a new Recipe object with the summed values and return that.
	
	3. There's a typo in 'rec1.suagr'. It should be 'rec1.sugar'. Also, there seems to be a missing '+' operator between 'rec1.sugar' and 'rec2.sugar'.
	
	4. The arguments passed to the 'merge_recipes' function in the assert_equal function do not match the function's parameters. The function expects two Recipe objects, not eight separate integers.

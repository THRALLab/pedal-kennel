The function `float` consumes a string and converts it to a float.
Use the `round` function and the `float` function together along with the `print` function to print the string `"9.5"` as a whole number after storing the result in a variable.

Here is an example of the `float` function being used to convert a string to a float:

```python
price = float("17.3")
```

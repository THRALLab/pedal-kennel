Define a function `dispatch_math` that consumes a string and two integers, and produces an integer. The first argument (the string) represents an operator: either `"+"`, `"-"`, or `"*"`. The second and third arguments (the integers) are meant to represent the operands for the given operator. The result will be the addition, subtraction, or product of the two operands based on the first parameter. If any other operator is given, just return `0`.
